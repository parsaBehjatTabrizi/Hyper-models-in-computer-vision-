# Hyper-models-in-computer-vision-
Using computer vision Hyper-models on Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)
# ü©ª Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-Rays using EfficientNet (Baseline & HyperModel)

## üìå Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting **Pneumonia** from **Chest X-Ray** images using deep learning techniques. The dataset used is the publicly available **Chest X-Ray Pneumonia** dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia), which includes images categorized into **train**, **val**, and **test** folders.

The project is divided into two main parts:
- A **baseline model** using EfficientNet-B0
- A **HyperModel** using EfficientNet-B3 with advanced training enhancements

## üß† Part 1: Baseline Model with EfficientNet-B0

The first model uses a lightweight and efficient CNN, **EfficientNet-B0**, to classify chest X-ray images. It was trained using standard data preprocessing techniques without any complex optimization strategies.

**Key Details**:
- Input size: 224x224
- Optimizer: Adam
- Loss: CrossEntropyLoss
- Trained for 5 epochs
- Evaluated using the separate `test` dataset

**üîç Result**:  
The baseline EfficientNet-B0 model achieved an **average accuracy of 81.09%** on the test dataset.

## üöÄ Part 2: HyperModel with EfficientNet-B3

To improve performance, a more advanced version was built using **EfficientNet-B3**, paired with a range of optimization strategies:

**Enhancements Applied**:
- Advanced **data augmentation** (random flip, rotation)
- **Learning rate scheduler** for adaptive training
- **Early stopping** to prevent overfitting
- **Confusion matrix** and **classification report** for detailed test evaluation
- **EfficientNet-B3** backbone for improved feature extraction

**üìà Result**:  
The HyperModel achieved **higher accuracy** than the baseline model, outperforming the initial 81.09% by a significant margin, while also providing deeper insight into the model's performance across both classes.
